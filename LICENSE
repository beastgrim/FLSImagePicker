# FLSImagePickerController

*A clone of the UIImagePickerController using the Assets Library Framework allowing for multiple asset selection.*

## Usage

The image picker is created and displayed in a very similar manner to the `UIImagePickerController`. The sample application  shows its use. To display the controller you instantiate it and display it modally like so.

```obj-c
FLSImagePickerController *imagePicker = [FLSImagePickerController new];
[self presentViewController:imagePicker animated:YES completion:nil];

imagePicker.completionHandler = ^(NSArray *selectedAssets) {
    __block NSInteger count = selectedAssets.count;
    if (count == 0) return;

    PHImageRequestOptions * options = [[PHImageRequestOptions alloc] init];
    options.networkAccessAllowed    = YES;
    options.deliveryMode            = PHImageRequestOptionsDeliveryModeHighQualityFormat;
    options.resizeMode              = PHImageRequestOptionsResizeModeFast;
    options.version                 = PHImageRequestOptionsVersionCurrent;

    for (PHAsset * asset in selectedAssets) {

        if ([asset isKindOfClass:[PHAsset class]]) {

            CGFloat scale = 400.0 / asset.pixelHeight;
            CGFloat newWidth = floorf(asset.pixelWidth * scale);
            CGSize size = CGSizeMake(newWidth, 400.0);

            [[PHImageManager defaultManager] requestImageForAsset:asset targetSize:size contentMode:PHImageContentModeAspectFill options:options resultHandler:^(UIImage *  _Nullable result, NSDictionary * _Nullable info) {
            NSLog(@"IMAGE %@", result);
            }];
        }
    }
};
